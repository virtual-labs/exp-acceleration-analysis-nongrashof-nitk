* Edit the parameters in variable section and observe the changes taking place in the acceleration diagram of the four bar mechanism.

* Table will show the value of the parameters.

* Notice that there are two accelerations of a point on a rotating link. One acceleration (Centripetal, magnitude =rω2) is along the link directed towards the point about which the link is rotating. The other acceleration (tangential, magnitude =rα) is perpendicular to the link and directed in the direction of rotation of link.

* Total acceleration of the point on the link is the resultant of centripetal and tangential accelerations.
